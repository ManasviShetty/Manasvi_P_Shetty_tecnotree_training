        Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was an Indian Hindu monk and one of the most influential spiritual leaders of the modern era. He was a disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna and was instrumental in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world.

        Born in Calcutta, India, Vivekananda was educated in both Western and Indian traditions. He was deeply interested in the spiritual and social issues of his time and spent much of his life travelling and giving lectures on these topics. In 1893, he represented Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, where his speech on the unity of religions became one of the highlights of the event.

        Vivekananda's teachings emphasised the universality of religion and the importance of self-realisation as a means of attaining true freedom and happiness. He founded the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897 to help spread the teachings of Vedanta and provide social services to the poor and needy in India. Vivekananda died at the young age of 39, but his legacy has continued to inspire people around the world.
